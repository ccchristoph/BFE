# BFE
Basis Function Estimator

Our goal is to find an **analytical expression** as a function from a given numerical dataset. We explore different approaches from **supervised learning** methods to **reinforcement learning**. 
Our `func.py` class is the foundation of our approaches. It takes any analytical mathematical function as an input and is able to decompose the function into a binary tree (considering the order of operations). It is similar to `sympy` but gives us the flexibility to perform various custom methods like exploring new functions by inserting nodes or to extract additional features from the function.
